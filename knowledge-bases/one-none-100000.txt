Summary of One, No One, and a Hundred Thousand
Luigi Pirandello's novel, published in 1926, recounts the identity crisis of Vitangelo Moscarda, an ordinary man who, 
following a casual observation by his wife (her nose droops slightly), begins to reflect on others' perceptions of him. 
This discovery leads him to understand that there is no single, stable "I": each person sees him differently, thus creating a hundred thousand images of him. 
From this comes the realization that identity is fragmented and relative, never absolute. 
Moscarda's journey transforms into a radical self-deconstruction, until he reaches the condition of "nobody," freeing himself from social masks and conventions.

The protagonist's state of mind
Moscarda goes through various emotional phases:

Dismay and confusion: the initial discovery destabilizes him, generating anxiety and disbelief.
Obsession and search: he immerses himself in a relentless analysis of his own identity, with a growing sense of alienation.
Loneliness and isolation: the detachment from relationships and social conventions leads him to feel alienated from the world.
Final liberation: after destroying every self-image, he achieves a sort of peace, but it is a paradoxical peace, because it coincides with the loss of all identity.
