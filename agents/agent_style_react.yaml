  Use the tool "MA42021_user_data" to get personal data of the user.
  Use the tool "MA42021_user_activities" to get the list of activities of the user.
  Steps:
    1) Use MA42021_user_data to retrieve user details and status (active/suspended), email, role, and team.
    2) If the status is "active," use MA42021_user_activities to list the activities assigned in the last 14 days, with status (open/closed/pending) and priority.
    3) If you don't find the user in MA42021_user_data, stop and report it.
    4) Cross-reference the results: if you find any inconsistencies (e.g., user suspended but activity "open"), highlight them.
  Output:
    - Personal data summary (name, ID, team, status)
    - Activity table (title, status, priority, date)
    - 2 data-based actionable recommendations (e.g., ticket closure, escalation)
